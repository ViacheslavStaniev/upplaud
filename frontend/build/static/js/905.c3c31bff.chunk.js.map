(“Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of its\n        users (“user” or “you”) that use our website located at https://upplaud.com/, including\n        other media forms, media channels, mobile website or mobile application related or connected\n        thereto (collectively, the “Website”). The following Company privacy policy (“Privacy\n        Policy”) is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website, about the types of information\n        that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of the\n        Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and\n        discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. Changes to this\n        Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the Website,\n        however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time you\n        use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the\n        beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the Website.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        The Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and\n        federal law. If you are accessing our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised\n        that you are transferring your personal information to us in the United States, and by using\n        our Website, you consent to that transfer and use of your personal information in accordance\n        with this Privacy Policy.

Like most website operators,\n        Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort\n        that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information\n        includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the\n        locations of the websites the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and\n        immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not\n        Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP\n        address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s\n        point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes\n        Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company\n        better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in\n        usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in\n        terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the\n        Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as\n        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Web Cookies</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a\n        website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website\n        each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep\n        track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login\n        name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website and\n        to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that\n        users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and\n        to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other\n        Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes\n        and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help\n        Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY\n        USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR\n        BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT\n        CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES.\n        WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF\n        FUNCTIONALITY.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Third-Party Advertisers</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website. These\n        companies may use information (not including any Personally-Identifying Information) about\n        your visits to the Website and other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to\n        provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Using a tool created by\n        the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third-party ad servers’ and\n        networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would like more information about this practice\n        and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please\n        follow the following links: http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp,\n        http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Please contact us\n        if you would like to know the identity of the third-party advertising companies we are\n        currently using to serve ads.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their\n        advertisements, and we may use any of the Non-Personally Identifying Information we have\n        collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as\n        your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the\n        appropriate audience for those advertisements. We do not identify you to the advertiser.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Web Beacons</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually\n        invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a\n        particular web page or an email. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to\n        count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded\n        services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information. They\n        are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web\n        Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and\n        date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon\n        resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by\n        declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web\n        Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.{' '}\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Analytics</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the\n        Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together\n        to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including\n        Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among\n        other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better\n        understand online activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and used by\n        Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser\n        (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for Display\n        Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads Settings\n        (www.google.com/settings/ads).\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of\n        the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies\n        to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of third parties.\n        We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with additional\n        Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also may share\n        aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors,\n        for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our\n        advertisers the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or services\n        accessed. This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may\n        be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find\n        of interest and to target content and advertising.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Mobile Device Additional Terms</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Website or download any of our\n        applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and\n        manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or\n        track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading\n        or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for Company\n        to determine from an IP address the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in\n        which case we may gather and use such general location data.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting\n        you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters. If you\n        wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your\n        device’s settings.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the\n        functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information,\n        such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application,\n        aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do not\n        link the information we store within the analytics software to any Personally-Identifying\n        Information you submit within the mobile application.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={4}>SOCIAL MEDIA </Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Website to your account on some\n        social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or enabling\n        certain features on the Website. When logging in using your social network credentials, we\n        may collect the Personally-Identifying Information you have made publicly available on the\n        social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo, username, gender,\n        friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other information you have made\n        public. Once connected, other users may also be able to see information about your social\n        network, such as the size of your network and your friends, including common friends. By\n        connecting your account on the Website to your account on any social networking site, you\n        hereby consent to the continuous release of information about you to us. We will not send\n        any of your account information to the connected social networking site without first\n        disclosing that to you. Each social network may further allow you to set privacy controls\n        around your information on their system, and our collection of information will always\n        follow such controls and permissions. This feature is subject to continuous change and\n        improvement by us and each social networking site involved, and therefore the available\n        features and shared information are subject to change without notice to you.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect you to a social network if you\n        click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as\n        Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social\n        network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that provider’s\n        servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data will be sent to the respective\n        social network’s plugin provider. So for example, when you click on the Facebook’s “Like”\n        button on the Website, Facebook will receive your IP address, the browser version and screen\n        resolution, and the operating system of the device you have used to access the Website.\n        Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the websites of these social networks\n        and are not within our control.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={4}>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</Title>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Website Registration</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly\n        associated with a specific person. Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying\n        Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information\n        collected by Company about users is information provided by users themselves when (1)\n        registering for our service, (2) logging in with social network credentials, (3)\n        participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of our service, or responding to\n        offers or advertisements, (4) communicating with us, (5) creating a public profile or (6)\n        signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each user’s name, address,\n        email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial\n        information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or\n        other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and\n        activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic or\n        relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are\n        under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind,\n        with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain\n        Website features.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Paragraph strong>\n        BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR\n        PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF\n        PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION” SECTION.\n      </Paragraph>\n\n      <Title level={5}>Online Postings</Title>\n\n      <Paragraph>\n        Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter\n        of course as a result of your use of the Website. We may provide areas on the Website where\n        you can post reviews and other information relating to your activities on the Website. Such\n        postings are governed by our Terms of Use.
