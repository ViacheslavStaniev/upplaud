The following Company privacy policy\n          (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website, about the types of\n          information that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use\n          of the Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and\n          discloses that information, and your rights in relation to that information. Changes to\n          this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the\n          Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each\n          time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears\n          at the beginning of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the\n          Website.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          The Website is hosted in the United States of America and is subject to U.S. state and\n          federal law. If you are accessing our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised\n          that you are transferring your personal information to us in the United States, and by\n          using our Website, you consent to that transfer and use of your personal information in\n          accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Like most\n          website operators, Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying\n          Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make\n          available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating\n          system, browser type and the locations of the websites the user views right before\n          arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such\n          information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Company to\n          determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic\n          location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data.\n          Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website\n          to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns\n          and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’\n          experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also\n          release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the\n          aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Web Cookies</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a\n          website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website\n          each time the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep\n          track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login\n          name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website\n          and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages\n          that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’\n          experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other\n          Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company\n          analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to\n          help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used.\n          COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET\n          THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING\n          THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB\n          COOKIES.

Using a tool\n          created by the Network Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third-party ad\n          servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would like more information\n          about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by\n          these companies, please follow the following links:\n          http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or\n          http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

We do not identify you to the advertiser.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Web Beacons</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually\n          invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a\n          particular web page or an email. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails\n          to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded\n          services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information.\n          They are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage.\n          Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time\n          and date of a page or email view and a description of the page or email on which the Web\n          Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective\n          by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a\n          Web Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual\n          basis.{' '}\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Analytics</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the\n          Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together\n          to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including\n          Google Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among\n          other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and\n          better understand online activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and\n          used by Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser\n          (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google Analytics for\n          Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads Settings\n          (www.google.com/settings/ads).\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of\n          the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate\n          companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of\n          third parties. We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with\n          additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also\n          may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and\n          investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may\n          tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features\n          or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying\n          Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and\n          other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Mobile Device Additional Terms</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Website or download any of our\n          applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and\n          manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access or\n          track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading\n          or using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for\n          Company to determine from an IP address the geographic location of your point of\n          connectivity, in which case we may gather and use such general location data.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them, letting\n          you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters. If you\n          wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in\n          your device’s settings.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the\n          functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information,\n          such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application,\n          aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do\n          not link the information we store within the analytics software to any\n          Personally-Identifying Information you submit within the mobile application.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={4}>SOCIAL MEDIA </Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          We may provide you the option to connect your account on the Website to your account on\n          some social networking sites for the purpose of logging in, uploading information or\n          enabling certain features on the Website. When logging in using your social network\n          credentials, we may collect the Personally-Identifying Information you have made publicly\n          available on the social networking site, such as your name, profile picture, cover photo,\n          username, gender, friends network, age range, locale, friend list and any other\n          information you have made public. Once connected, other users may also be able to see\n          information about your social network, such as the size of your network and your friends,\n          including common friends. By connecting your account on the Website to your account on any\n          social networking site, you hereby consent to the continuous release of information about\n          you to us. We will not send any of your account information to the connected social\n          networking site without first disclosing that to you. Each social network may further\n          allow you to set privacy controls around your information on their system, and our\n          collection of information will always follow such controls and permissions. This feature\n          is subject to continuous change and improvement by us and each social networking site\n          involved, and therefore the available features and shared information are subject to\n          change without notice to you.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          We may use hyperlinks on the Website which will redirect you to a social network if you\n          click on the respective link. However, when you click on a social plug-in, such as\n          Facebook’s “Like” button, Twitter’s “tweet” button or the Google+, that particular social\n          network’s plugin will be activated and your browser will directly connect to that\n          provider’s servers. If you do not use these buttons, none of your data will be sent to the\n          respective social network’s plugin provider. So for example, when you click on the\n          Facebook’s “Like” button on the Website, Facebook will receive your IP address, the\n          browser version and screen resolution, and the operating system of the device you have\n          used to access the Website. Settings regarding privacy protection can be found on the\n          websites of these social networks and are not within our control.\n        </Paragraph>\n\n        <Title level={4}>\n          COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n        </Title>\n\n        <Title level={5}>Website Registration</Title>\n\n        <Paragraph>\n          As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly\n          associated with a specific person. Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying\n          Information from and about Website users.
