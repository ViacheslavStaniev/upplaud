This Agreement and all aspects of the Website and Company\n          Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the\n          State of New York, without regard to conflict of law provisions. With respect to any\n          disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution or arbitration (as set forth\n          below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other\n          than in the state and federal courts located in New York County County, State of New York,\n          and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and\n          forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal\n          courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n          Sale of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Additionally, application of the Uniform\n          Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from this Agreement. In no event\n          shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Website or Company\n          Services be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Informal Resolution. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,\n          controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Company agree to first\n          attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)\n          informally for at least one hundred eighty (180) days before initiating any arbitration or\n          court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person\n          to the other.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Binding Arbitration. If you and Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal\n          negotiations, either you or Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes\n          expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any\n          election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND\n          THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY\n          TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration\n          Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s\n          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of\n          which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute\n          is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined\n          by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator\n          compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited\n          by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive,\n          Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in\n          person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make\n          a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a\n          party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the\n          arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or\n          applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York County County, State of New\n          York. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in\n          court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,\n          vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Restrictions. You and Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute\n          between Company and you individually.
